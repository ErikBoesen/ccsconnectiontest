# CCS Connection Test for GNU/Linux & macOS

A version of the CyberPatriot connection test for GNU/Linux, macOS, and other UNIX-based hosts.

This script will run the same tests as the official CyberPatriot CCS Connection Test, but on the aforementioned systems, for which there are no official test applications.

This version of the connection test runs in the command line rather than a GUI, for the sake of simplicity.

## Running
Like any other shell script:
```sh
./test.sh
```
