# CCS Connection Test for GNU/Linux

Linux version of the CyberPatriot connection test.

This script will run the same tests as the official CyberPatriot CCS Connection Test, and is compatible with GNU/Linux systems, for which there's no official test application. Furthermore, it's CLI based rather than GUI, because real *GNU SLASH* Linux users don't need GUIs.

## Running
Like any other shell script:
```sh
./test.sh
```
